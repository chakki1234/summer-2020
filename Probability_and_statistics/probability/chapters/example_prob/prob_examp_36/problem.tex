Let X denote the number of hours you study during a randomly selected school day. The
probability that X can take the values x, has the following form, where k is some unknown constant.
\begin{align}
\begin{pmatrix}
0.1, if \  x =  0  \\ 
kx, if \  x = 1 \  or \  2 \\
k\brak{5-x}, if \  x = 3\  or \ 4 \\ 
0, otherwise
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the value of k.
\item What is the probability that you study at least two hours ? Exactly two hours? At most
two hours?
\end{enumerate}
